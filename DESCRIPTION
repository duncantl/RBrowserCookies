Package: RBrowserCookies
Version: 0.2-0
Title: Get cookies from browsers
Description: This allows an R user to query a browser's database of  cookies.
  Currently this only supports Firefox, but we'll add support for Google Chrome soon.
  (Send mail asking for this.)
  One purpose of this package is to allow a user to login to a Web site in their browser,
  collect the cookie from the browser, and then use this in R requests to that Web site.
